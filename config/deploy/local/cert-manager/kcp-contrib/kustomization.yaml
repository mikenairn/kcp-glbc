# Local deployment overlay.
#
# This requires the following .env and .kubeconfig files to exist in this directory before it can be used:
# controller-config.env
# aws-credentials.env
#
# These can be generated using `make generate-ld-config` and then modified as required.
# `make generate-ld-config` creates configuration for the local dev environment so you must have ran `make local-setup` first.
